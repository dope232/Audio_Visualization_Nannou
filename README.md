# Audio Visualization with Nannou

This project demonstrates real-time audio visualization using the **Nannou** creative coding framework. 


## Dependencies

Add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
nannou = "0.18.0"
nannou_audio = "0.18.0"
ringbuf = "0.4.0"

## To-Do

- [ ] Add support for `.wav` and `.mp3` files instead of realtime audio 
- [ ] Apply FFT for frequency-domain visualization as well 
- [ ] Implement circular visualization for audio data  
- [ ] Experiment with enhanced visualization techniques (e.g., colors, gradients, animations)
